## Programs Included

### 1. Grade Calculator

**Purpose:**  
Takes the marks of three subjects from the user, calculates the average, and assigns a grade with a motivational message.

**Key Concepts:**
- User input using `cin`
- Arithmetic average
- Conditional grading logic
- Friendly output messages

**Sample Output:**

Enter your marks for three subjects (out of 100):98,97,90

Average: 95%

Grade: A

Excellent work! You're acing it.

### 2. Number Type Identifier

**Purpose:**  
Asks the user to enter a number and classifies it as positive, negative, or zero with an encouraging message.

**Key Concepts:**
- Integer input
- Conditional branching
- Output with a personal touch

**Sample Output:**

### 3. Coordinate Quadrant Detector

**Purpose:**  
Takes (x, y) coordinates as input and determines in which quadrant the point lies, or whether it's on an axis or at the origin.

**Key Concepts:**
- Logical operators (`&&`)
- Decision-making using `if-else` chains
- Geometric reasoning

**Sample Output:**

Enter x:10


Enter y:20

1st quadrant
