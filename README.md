## How to Run These Programs

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like `g++`) installed.
2. Clone the repository or copy any `.cpp` file.
3. Compile using the terminal:
   ```bash
   g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
## Conclusion

These programs provide a practical introduction to core C++ concepts such as variables, data types, input/output operations, and conditional logic. By working through real-world examples—calculating grades, identifying number types, locating points on a coordinate plane, and exploring data type sizes—beginners can build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals.

The friendly messages and clear outputs make the learning process engaging and intuitive, encouraging users to experiment and deepen their understanding of C++. This collection serves as an excellent starting point for anyone embarking on their journey to becoming proficient in C++ programming.
